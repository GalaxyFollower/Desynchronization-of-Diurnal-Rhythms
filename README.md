## Method of measuring desynchronization of diurnal rhythms and quantification of circadian/diurnal variability

#### Our method of measuring internal desynchronization of diurnal rhythms through fitting sinusoids (Cosinor method [1]) and an extension to quantify circadian/diurnal variability.

When using this code to measure rhythms, please cite [our paper](http://desynlink.paper.oc.com):

And to quantify diurnal variability, please cite [our paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-19888-9):

## Using the code

To run all of the code, the script `Example.m` and two data recordings (`Acceleration Example.csv` and `Heart Rate Example.csv`) are provided.

This recreates: Figure 1, the measures in Table 1, and Figure 2 from [2]; and also all diurnal variability measures from [3].
